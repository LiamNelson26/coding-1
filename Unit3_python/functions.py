# What is a function?

# A function is a set of instructions that performs a specific
# task or job. 

# there are two variable of functions in Python
# Built-in Functions - Instructions that are pre-written in python 
# programming language.

# print() is a built in function. When we pass in data it will output 
# it into the terminal automatically.
print('Coding Class')

# input() is a built in function. It allows us to write and pass in
# data into our program from the terminal.
name = input('what is your name? ')
print(name)

number= int(input('pleas eprove a number'))
print(23*number)
