# 1.  A function is a form of code to instruct a computer to perform a task.") 

# 2.  The difference between a function parameter and a function argument is that function 
# parameters are placeholder of data for the function definition, and function arguments are 
# when we pass data into a function call of evidence and facts.

# 3.  An if/else conditional statements are used to give the ability to control 
# data types and decide on what we do with the data.

# 4.  Integer data types are whole numbers and not decimals.

# 5.  Boolean data types are "true or false" values.

# 6.  The comparison operator works best for the function.

# 7.  The assignment operator works best for the function.
