<p>My name is Liam Nelson, and I am a 9th grader. After I graduate high school, I plan to go to college and focus on studying architecture and civil engineering for my future. I will push myself toward my passion to benefit the world. I will use my knowledge and skills to create building to improve the quality of life for civilians. I also want to collaborate with other architects to help me grow as an architecture. </p>
